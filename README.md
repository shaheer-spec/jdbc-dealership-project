# Dealership Workshop

## Description of the Project

This program allows users to browse available vehicles, add new vehicles, remove vehicles, and view the full dealership inventory.
All vehicle data is stored in a text file so that information remains saved even after the program is closed.
## User Stories


- As a user, I want to add a new vehicle to the dealership inventory, so that I can keep the system updated with the latest available cars.
- As a user, I want to remove a vehicle from the inventory, so that I can keep the system accurate when a car is sold or no longer available.
- As a user, I want to search for vehicles by different filters (such as make, model, price, or year), so that I can quickly find cars that meet my needs.
- As a user, I want to lease a vehicle through the system, so that I can generate a lease contract and track leasing details easily.
